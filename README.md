# THE RULES OF FISH

A six-player card game utilizing all 52 cards as well as the 2 Jokers, for a total of 54 cards in circulation.

## BASIC PREGAME INFORMATION

Fish is a game of implicit communication, where players must track (or attempt to track) all 54 cards in play. A skilled player knows both what their own team has and what the opponent has, and makes decisions based on who has each card.

The six players are split into 2 teams, with three players on each team. The goal for each team is to form sets, where a set consists of 6 cards and there are 9 sets total. 

The 9 sets are as follows: 2-7 of clubs, 2-7 of diamonds, 2-7 of spades, 2-7 of hearts, 8-K of clubs, 8-K of diamonds, 8-K of spades, 8-K of hearts, and the last set consists of the 4 As and the 2 Jokers. 

The first team to 5 completed sets wins. 

## FORMING SETS

The primary mode of gathering information is to ask a member of the opposing team a question regarding a specific card. A coin-flip scenario may determine which team gets to ask the first question. 

For example, let there be players A, B, C, D, E, and F. Players A, B, and C are on Team Red, and players D, E, and F are on Team Blue. 

Let's say Team Red asks first, and player A asks the question: "Player D, do you have the Ace of Spades?" If player D does, they must hand it over to player A and player A may ask another question (to any player, not limited to just player D). If player D doesn't, the turn for Team Red is over and player D may now ask a question to any member of Team Red. 

## CONDITIONS FOR QUESTIONING

1. To inquire about a card, the asker must have a card in the respective set. To return to the previous example, player A must have had a card in the Ace-Joker set. Asking for a card in a set where you do not have any stake is not allowed. 

2. You may not ask questions of your own teammates. Questions may only be directed to a player of the opposing team. In a similar vein, no verbal communication regarding card location may occur between teammates during the game.

3. Memory is one of the key elements of this game. Therefore, players may only ask what the previous question was. For example, no player may inquire what question was asked two turns ago, they may only ask to hear what the most recent question was.
